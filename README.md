This project involves creating an automatic fan control system using an Arduino microcontroller. The fan turns on when the temperature exceeds a set threshold, which can be adjusted using a rotary encoder. A temperature sensor continuously monitors the ambient temperature, and the Arduino processes this data to control the fan. The system is designed to maintain a stable environment by turning the fan on or off based on the user-defined temperature setting.
